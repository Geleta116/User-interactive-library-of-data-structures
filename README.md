# User-interactive-library-of-data-structures

USER INTERACTIVE DATA STRUCTUR LIBRARY
This user interactive data structure library is a library of 5 structure which the user can create and manipulate.
It is a library of data structure created for users who don’t have a coding skill which reaches to creating a user defined data structure such as linked list.
These 5 data structure libraries include stack, Queue, singly linked list, doubly linked list, and circular doubly linked list.
## What problem does this project solve?
This project solves one main core problem which is enabling people who don’t have sufficient coding abilities to create such data structures on their own . There for in our project we devised two phases
1.Implementing the data structures mentioned above
2.Implementing the user interactive part of the project
In the first phase we implemented the codes for each of the 5 data structures and we also implemented some unique manipulations to make them display values rather than printing them
In the second phase we created a main method that will receive input from users in order to perform the creating and manipulations requested by the user.
The system displays different prompts and actions with every number entered until the number assigned to break the statement is called.
## ACTIONS THAT A USER CAN MAKE ARE DISPLAYED IN THE TABLE BELOW
